<div style="z-index: 50; max-width: 400px;">
<p>I'm a computer scientist with a BSCS from Georgia Tech concentrating in
theory and intelligence. I am interested in general intelligence for machines
and hope to put machine intelligence to the fullest possible use through
application to biology. Currently, I am doing research in the <a
href="https://www.janelia.org/lab/turaga-lab">Turaga lab</a> at <a
href="https://www.janelia.org/">Janelia</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, I was a student researcher at the <a
href="https://genaamics.org">Paaby lab</a> working on computer vision for
quantitative genetics and I gave lectures at <a
href="https://gtagency.github.io">The Agency</a> (the Georgia Tech AI/ML
club) and <a href="https://theoryclub.github.io">Theory Club</a> (the
Georgia Tech theoretical CS club).</p>
